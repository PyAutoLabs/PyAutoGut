# Active Tasks

## plot-coverage-gaps
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoLens/issues/667
- session: claude --resume 25fb2cf0-1a9e-48fa-a1a7-9c53f5b57433
- status: awaiting-merge — all three legs at PR-open; merge is a human act
- library-pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoLens/pull/668 (OPEN, pending-release; commit c3c00874c; 488 tests passed)
- workspace-pr: autolens_workspace#404 (72ff4e6f), autogalaxy_workspace#191 (c9746d0) — both OPEN, pending-release
- merge-order: PyAutoLens#668 FIRST (autolens_workspace/scripts/interferometer/plot.py calls the newly exported subplot_interferometer_dataset); autogalaxy_workspace#191 has no library dependency and may merge independently
- validation: 7/7 touched plot.py scripts ran sequentially in test mode with visualization on against the branch build; coverage matrix re-run on the EDITED files = 22/22 planned gaps closed; *_x1_plane exclusion verified; leak check clean (fits_* write to gitignored output/plot/); notebook regen touched only the 7 notebooks + 2 catalogue files
- coverage: plot.py 18→36 of 63 exported (autolens_workspace), 11→14 of 28 (autogalaxy_workspace)
- followups: draft/docs/workspaces/plot_coverage_followups.md — (1) demo subplot_fit_interferometer_combined (exported in #668 but demonstrated NOWHERE; needs a multi-dataset interferometer context), (2) demo subplot_ellipse_errors (needs a real posterior fit_pdf_list), (3) docs/api/plot.rst omits 6 already-exported symbols, (4) autolens.plot shadows its OWN subplot_fit_dirty_images with autogalaxy's — the AL version taking image_plane_lines is reachable under no exported name
- prompt: active/plot_py_function_coverage_gaps.md
- classification: docs (both — library → workspace); follow-on to plot-guides-restructure, which built the per-dataset plot.py family but never enumerated per-file function coverage
- brain-override: Feature Agent returned too-large (15) + a 4-phase split (design/core_api/workspace_examples/docs); overridden to one combined task — it scored 3 repos, not the work (2 import lines + 7 files gaining sections); there is no design left and no core API. Precedent: vacuous-jax-assertions (large/8 → small), multiband-pyloop-batching
- conflict-note: worktree_check_conflict flagged PyAutoLens as claimed by python-312-floor — hand-verified STALE (`git worktree list` shows one canonical worktree on main; main is 3 commits past the claimed b40fb0ba; that task records "next-phase: none — all phases complete"; its `- Repo` lines are a completion record, not a live claim). autolens_workspace is also claimed by group-start-here-timeout; surfaces disjoint (that task owns scripts/group/start_here.py; this one owns scripts/{imaging,interferometer,weak,cluster,point_source}/plot.py)
- heart-ack: test run status unknown (no report.json); release validation stale: source moved since rehearsal (PyAutoFit, PyAutoArray, PyAutoGalaxy, PyAutoLens)
- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/plot-coverage-gaps
- repos:
  - PyAutoLens (feature/plot-coverage-gaps)
  - autolens_workspace (feature/plot-coverage-gaps)

- phase-3-live-outcome: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHands/issues/208#issuecomment-5123225967
- phase-3-pypi: autonerves/autofit/autoarray/autogalaxy/autolens `2026.7.29.2`; all unyanked with two artifacts and `Requires-Python >=3.12`
- phase-3-followups: assistant wiki-currency workflows still run Python 3.11; PyAutoHands pre-build commit `95f7502` accidentally staged `=3.12` and `run_logs/`; the AutoGalaxy nufftax smoke failure is within the already-acknowledged workspace-validation class
- phase-5-census: tracked active selectors below 3.12 remain in three assistant wiki workflows, PyAutoMemory validation, and six workspace/HowTo `runtime.txt` files; PyAutoHeart's Python 3.11 rejection job is intentional, while the PyAutoHands summary text and PyAutoFit `h5py>=3.11.0` dependency are not interpreter selectors
- phase-5a: COMPLETE — PyAutoHands#210, autofit_assistant#25, autolens_assistant#95, autocti_assistant#15, and PyAutoMemory#31 merged; related assistant baseline fixes #97/#98, #26/#27, and #16/#17 also merged green
- phase-5b: COMPLETE 2026-07-30 — six `runtime.txt` PRs merged unchanged (autofit_workspace#128, autogalaxy_workspace#189, autolens_workspace#399, HowToFit#40, HowToGalaxy#51, HowToLens#63); record: complete/2026/07/python-312-workspace-runtime-pins.md
- phase-3-release-decision: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHands/issues/208#issuecomment-5121606547

- phase-4d-prompt: active/python_312_floor_phase_4d_euclid_assistant.md
- phase-4d-pr: https://github.com/Jammy2211/euclid_assistant/pull/11
- phase-4d-status: merged-unchanged (51143df2); issue auto-closed
- next-phase: none — all phases complete; remaining act is the explicit human close of PyAutoNerves#142 (and PyAutoCTI#100, PyAutoReduce#59, PyAutoHeart#113)
- branch: none for the completed release; corrective follow-ups require normal task branches

- commits: PyAutoNerves f06dd40, a3ed651 (pushed)
- opus-review: Claude Opus 5 CLEAN on all five exact PR heads; cross-repository
  consistency CLEAN; all five safe to merge in any order
- issue-close-status: euclid_assistant#10 auto-closed by its PR; PyAutoNerves#142,
  PyAutoCTI#100, PyAutoReduce#59, and PyAutoHeart#113 remain open for explicit
  human close authorization
- heart-ack: workspace validation not passing (13 failed, 2026-07-21T19-05-22Z); 33 stale parked script(s)

  - PyAutoReduce: main (`d7bd916a`)
  - euclid_assistant: main (`51143df2`)
- notes: Phase 1A and all independent Phase 4 slices merged unchanged after a
  combined max-effort Claude Opus 5 review returned CLEAN for each exact head.
  Tests, CI where present, wheel metadata, smoke checks, dependency caps, live
  documentation, and protected historical/provenance scope were independently
  checked. Opus confirmed two planned release-sequencing hazards: the remaining
  four core library floors must rise before publication, and Heart's legacy
  below-floor install/banner checks must be rewritten in Phase 2. JAX 0.11 and
  Python 3.14 support remain separate follow-ups. Phase 1B merged unchanged as
  PyAutoArray#419 (`41c55a44`) after all four CI jobs passed the exact Claude
  Opus 5-reviewed head `ca98473a`; no release was performed. The human accepted
  the sole sequential smoke timeout as non-causal. Phase 1C now starts in
  PyAutoFit. A separate pre-existing PyNUFFT/SciPy dev-extra incompatibility was
  reproduced on unmodified main and recorded as a draft bug. Phase 1C is open
  as PyAutoFit#1429 at exact reviewed commit `70d31a3e`: both supported
  runtimes pass 1559 tests with one skip, wheel metadata is correct, Claude
  Opus 5 returned CLEAN, and Heart remains within the acknowledged YELLOW set.
  The identical accepted subhalo smoke timeout is the sole sequential failure.
  Phase 1C merged unchanged as PyAutoFit#1429 (`241f2d69c`) after all five CI
  checks passed the exact reviewed head. Phase 1D is open as PyAutoGalaxy#535
  at exact reviewed tree `1c34f3c8`: both supported runtimes pass 1009 tests,
  wheel metadata and the live census are correct, and the sole sequential
  smoke timeout is the exact accepted subhalo case. Opus 5 returned CLEAN
  after the separate pip-rollback documentation hazard was durably assigned
  to Phases 3 and 6 in Mind `e2acf4a`; Heart remains within the acknowledged
  YELLOW set. Phase 1D merged unchanged as PyAutoGalaxy#535 (`b9d9927f`)
  after all five CI checks passed the exact reviewed head. Phase 1E is
  registered as PyAutoLens#663; PyAutoHands remains deferred to Phase 2.
  Phase 1E merged unchanged as PyAutoLens#664 (`b40fb0ba`) after Claude Opus 5
  returned CLEAN on byte-identical review tree `83b157014` and all five CI
  checks passed exact head `5b42f3e4`. The full five-library core floor is now
  merged; no release or issue closure was performed. Advance to Phase 2.

## vacuous-jax-assertions
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace_test/issues/229
- status: awaiting-merge
- workspace-pr: autolens_workspace_test#230, autogalaxy_workspace_test#99 (both OPEN, pending-release)
- prompt: active/vacuous_jax_assertions_release_profile.md
- heart-ack: workspace validation not passing (13 failed, 2026-07-21T19-05-22Z); 33 stale parked script(s); manifest drift: tenant firewall (organ code) — 6 mismatch(es) vs PyAutoMind/repos.yaml; release validation stale: source moved since rehearsal (PyAutoNerves, PyAutoFit, PyAutoArray, PyAutoGalaxy, PyAutoLens)
- notes: follow-up to PyAutoFit#1372 (CLOSED — its library finding was already fixed by PyAutoLens@83016c1ea, "PYAUTO_DISABLE_JAX has exactly one reader"; the sentinel it proposed was closed won't-do, no live consumer). Case A (latent_nan_robustness.py, both repos) is genuinely vacuous → RENAME to `_jax.py` so `derive_jax_markers` fires. Do NOT use an in-file `ENV: jax` declaration: it is profile-agnostic, so it would also flip SMOKE (both scripts are in smoke_tests.txt = the per-PR gate), and validate_env_profiles.py:152-161 calls that exact move "NOT migratable"; it would also evade the marker audit at :190-198, which tests `== "0"` while a declaration pops the var to absent. Case B (visualization.py, both repos) — `use_jax=True` is a NO-OP everywhere since ag/al default it True; drop the kwarg, fix the ag `"JAX/"` label; do NOT add ENV: jax (the modeling_visualization_jit family is already parked >300s). Profile default stays "1" per the release-profile-jax-default "DO NOT COPY" caveat. Brain scored large/8/research-first — OVERRIDDEN to small (scored the prompt's prose, not the work: 4 files, ~6 lines, 2 renames).
