  consistency CLEAN; all five safe to merge in any order
- issue-close-status: euclid_assistant#10 auto-closed by its PR; PyAutoNerves#142,
  PyAutoCTI#100, PyAutoReduce#59, and PyAutoHeart#113 remain open for explicit
  human close authorization
- heart-ack: workspace validation not passing (13 failed, 2026-07-21T19-05-22Z); 33 stale parked script(s); manifest drift: tenant firewall (organ code) — 6 mismatch(es) vs PyAutoMind/repos.yaml; release validation stale: source moved since rehearsal (PyAutoNerves, PyAutoFit, PyAutoArray, PyAutoGalaxy, PyAutoLens)

- notes: Phase 1A and all independent Phase 4 slices merged unchanged after a
  combined max-effort Claude Opus 5 review returned CLEAN for each exact head.
  Tests, CI where present, wheel metadata, smoke checks, dependency caps, live
  documentation, and protected historical/provenance scope were independently
  checked. Opus confirmed two planned release-sequencing hazards: the remaining
  four core library floors must rise before publication, and Heart's legacy
  below-floor install/banner checks must be rewritten in Phase 2. JAX 0.11 and
  Python 3.14 support remain separate follow-ups. Phase 1B merged unchanged as
  PyAutoArray#419 (`41c55a44`) after all four CI jobs passed the exact Claude
  Opus 5-reviewed head `ca98473a`; no release was performed. The human accepted
  the sole sequential smoke timeout as non-causal. Phase 1C now starts in
  PyAutoFit. A separate pre-existing PyNUFFT/SciPy dev-extra incompatibility was
  reproduced on unmodified main and recorded as a draft bug. Phase 1C is open
  as PyAutoFit#1429 at exact reviewed commit `70d31a3e`: both supported
  runtimes pass 1559 tests with one skip, wheel metadata is correct, Claude
  Opus 5 returned CLEAN, and Heart remains within the acknowledged YELLOW set.
  The identical accepted subhalo smoke timeout is the sole sequential failure.
  Phase 1C merged unchanged as PyAutoFit#1429 (`241f2d69c`) after all five CI
  checks passed the exact reviewed head. Phase 1D is open as PyAutoGalaxy#535
  at exact reviewed tree `1c34f3c8`: both supported runtimes pass 1009 tests,
  wheel metadata and the live census are correct, and the sole sequential
  smoke timeout is the exact accepted subhalo case. Opus 5 returned CLEAN
  after the separate pip-rollback documentation hazard was durably assigned
  to Phases 3 and 6 in Mind `e2acf4a`; Heart remains within the acknowledged
  YELLOW set. Phase 1D merged unchanged as PyAutoGalaxy#535 (`b9d9927f`)
  after all five CI checks passed the exact reviewed head. Phase 1E is
  registered as PyAutoLens#663; PyAutoHands remains deferred to Phase 2.
  Phase 1E merged unchanged as PyAutoLens#664 (`b40fb0ba`) after Claude Opus 5
  returned CLEAN on byte-identical review tree `83b157014` and all five CI
  checks passed exact head `5b42f3e4`. The full five-library core floor is now
  merged; no release or issue closure was performed. Advance to Phase 2.

## vacuous-jax-assertions
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace_test/issues/229
- status: awaiting-merge
- workspace-pr: autolens_workspace_test#230, autogalaxy_workspace_test#99 (both OPEN, pending-release)
- prompt: active/vacuous_jax_assertions_release_profile.md
- heart-ack: workspace validation not passing (13 failed, 2026-07-21T19-05-22Z); 33 stale parked script(s); manifest drift: tenant firewall (organ code) — 6 mismatch(es) vs PyAutoMind/repos.yaml; release validation stale: source moved since rehearsal (PyAutoNerves, PyAutoFit, PyAutoArray, PyAutoGalaxy, PyAutoLens)
- notes: follow-up to PyAutoFit#1372 (CLOSED — its library finding was already fixed by PyAutoLens@83016c1ea, "PYAUTO_DISABLE_JAX has exactly one reader"; the sentinel it proposed was closed won't-do, no live consumer). Case A (latent_nan_robustness.py, both repos) is genuinely vacuous → RENAME to `_jax.py` so `derive_jax_markers` fires. Do NOT use an in-file `ENV: jax` declaration: it is profile-agnostic, so it would also flip SMOKE (both scripts are in smoke_tests.txt = the per-PR gate), and validate_env_profiles.py:152-161 calls that exact move "NOT migratable"; it would also evade the marker audit at :190-198, which tests `== "0"` while a declaration pops the var to absent. Case B (visualization.py, both repos) — `use_jax=True` is a NO-OP everywhere since ag/al default it True; drop the kwarg, fix the ag `"JAX/"` label; do NOT add ENV: jax (the modeling_visualization_jit family is already parked >300s). Profile default stays "1" per the release-profile-jax-default "DO NOT COPY" caveat. Brain scored large/8/research-first — OVERRIDDEN to small (scored the prompt's prose, not the work: 4 files, ~6 lines, 2 renames).

## multistart-prodigy-compile
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_profiling/issues/93
- session: claude --resume 73eff5ef-e2f6-46ba-9304-60dade7008ac
- status: workspace-shipped, awaiting-merge
- workspace-pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_profiling/pull/94 (results-only, pending-release labelled, lint running at hand-off)
- heart-ack: 2026-07-28 — workspace validation not passing (13 failed, 2026-07-21T19-05-22Z); 33 stale parked script(s); manifest drift: tenant firewall (organ code); release validation stale (all pre-existing, none in autolens_profiling)
- verdict: phase A DONE. Single-band MultiStartProdigy compile is BENIGN on all endorsed model types (mge/rect/knn/delaunay_matern; worst ~3.5min cold 1-core laptop, <=75s cold / <=2s warm RAL 32-core). Multi-band lax.map explosion does NOT reproduce single-band -> **phase B (PyAutoFit pyloop) is an evidence-based NO-GO**; pyloop lever stays multi-band-FactorGraphModel-only. No PyAutoFit branch was ever created; #1414 serialisation concern is moot.
- resume-next: (1) RAL A100 job 331380 (queued behind external multi-day array on gpu-2; gpu-1 down) — when it runs, rsync rows from /mnt/ral/jnightin/autolens_profiling_census/scripts/misc/jax_compile/results/, filter tag `prodigy-census-a100-*`, append to README table + results JSON, commit to same branch (confirmatory only — do NOT block the merge on it); (2) merge PR#94 + close #93 (human); (3) route draft/research/autoarray/delaunay_callback_persistent_cache_miss.md via /start_dev — the one real defect found; (4) post-merge cleanup (worktree, branch, complete/2026/07 record).
