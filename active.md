# Active Tasks

## purge-autogalaxy-database
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace/issues/169
- session: claude
- status: workspace-dev
- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/purge-autogalaxy-database
- autonomy: supervised
- heart-ack: 2026-07-27 human acknowledged this workspace ship with the exact YELLOW reasons below; any new reason or RED verdict requires a fresh stop
  - workspace validation not passing (13 failed, 2026-07-21T19-05-22Z)
  - 33 stale parked script(s)
  - manifest drift: tenant firewall (organ code) — 5 mismatch(es) vs PyAutoMind/repos.yaml
  - release validation stale: source moved since rehearsal (PyAutoNerves, PyAutoFit, PyAutoArray, PyAutoGalaxy, PyAutoLens)
- prompt: active/purge_autogalaxy_database_datasets.md
- note: leg 2 of the dataset-bulk series. Opus archaeology verdict ORPHANED: purge dataset/database/simple__{0,1,2} (512 KB) AND delete the three light_sersic_exp simulators (no reader ever existed; sibling autolens guide is the oracle; 2026-07-13 allowlist call rested on stale prose start_here.py:65 — fix that line too). Regen notebooks + navigator catalogue (stale catalogue = known CI red). sma.fits keep-marker. Recover point e942d360. Feature Agent split overridden (repo-count proxy).

## testmode-env-drift
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoCTI/issues/95
- status: PRs OPEN awaiting merge — PyAutoCTI#96 (delete dead fixture) + PyAutoFit#1417 (docstring). KEY FINDING: the obvious fix (rename PYAUTOFIT_TEST_MODE -> PYAUTO_TEST_MODE) is WRONG. Nothing reads PYAUTOFIT_TEST_MODE so the aggregator autouse fixture was always a no-op; making the var LIVE actually enables test mode, which bypasses sampling so the aggregator has no samples -> 6/13 tests FAIL. Measured 3 ways: baseline(dead var)=13 passed; renamed=6 failed/7 passed; fixture DELETED=13 passed. Shipped the deletion (behaviour-preserving, deletes the trap). Two gitignored .claude/settings.local.json allowlists deliberately LEFT ALONE — rewriting them would change what those commands do; they are stale permission strings, not a defect.

- autonomy: safe
- prompt: active/pyautofit_test_mode_env_var_drift.md
- note: canonical knob is PYAUTO_TEST_MODE (autonerves/test_mode.py:14) + PYAUTO_TEST_MODE_SAMPLES. autocti_workspace_test/AGENTS.md:42 and autocti_assistant/skills/ac_fit_cti_model.md:126 already DOCUMENTED that PYAUTOFIT_TEST_MODE does not exist — trap documented instead of deleted; this task deletes it. NEXT: merge both PRs, then close #95.

## jax-joss-benchmarks
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace/issues/281
- status: PARKED-ON-JOB — #282 MERGED+cleaned; 8/8 runnable A100 rows committed (autolens_jax_joss@64204f6). SDP.81 prep = detached RAL job 330608 (330605 diagnosed: empty extracted/ leftover skipped untar via test-d guard; casatools import needs ~/.casa/data — both fixed; 42GB tarball CACHED, no re-download) (45GB ALMA Band6 download -> casatools venv -> 3-level export -> installs dataset/interferometer/{sdp81,sdp81_mid,sdp81_full} in /mnt/ral/jnightin/autolens_jax_joss). RESUME (short session): (1) check log /mnt/ral/jnightin/sdp81_prep_330608.log — expect 'SDP81 PREP ALL DONE' + per-level visibility counts; failure modes: casatools pip wheel on py3.12 (fallback = monolithic CASA tarball), datacolumn, MS_LIST empty (check find patterns); (2) sbatch interferometry benchmarks on A100: benchmarks/interferometer.py at --nvis default/mid/full + benchmarks/imaging_and_interferometer.py (pattern: /mnt/ral/jnightin/autolens_jax_joss/run_rest.sbatch); (3) scp results/*.json back, regen RESULTS.md, commit (guard: explicit file paths); (4) copy small sdp81/ product locally, rewrite scripts/interferometer/start_here.py on NEW branch (start_workspace; #282 merged) using it — decide hosting (commit few-MB FITS to workspace w/ .gitignore allowlist + git add -f, or Zenodo+SDP81_URL); (5) final issue #281 update. Also pending: cluster-tuning prompt draft/feature/autolens_workspace/joss_cluster_benchmark_tuning.md; weak JAX-viz PyAutoLens#614
