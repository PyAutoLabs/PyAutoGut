# Epics

Long-running multi-phase programmes — work that is bigger than any one task
and outlives any single issue. Each entry names the epic's canonical
**ledger**: the file that holds its phase/gate state, wherever it lives. The
dashboard renders these under In flight with a one-tap resume prompt that
works out where the epic stands from its ledger and continues it from the
next logical point — nobody should have to hunt for the issue that pairs
with an epic's current phase.

Schema per entry: `## <slug>` then `- title:` / `- ledger:` / `- notes:`
(and optionally `- status:` for a coarse, durable state — never per-phase
detail, which belongs in the ledger).

A member prompt declares its membership in its own header: `Epic: <slug>`
(this file's slug) plus an optional `Phase: <n>`. The dashboard then keeps
members out of the pick lists and work-type sections and shows them only
grouped, phase-ordered, under their epic — worked in order through the
epic, never picked standalone.

## jax-inference-profiling
- title: JAX profiling — inference programme
- ledger: autolens_profiling/results/notes/inference/PROGRAMME.md
- notes: DECISIONS.md (append-only gate log) and phase_<NN>_*/RESULTS.md sit beside the ledger; slices ship as autolens_profiling issues/PRs, not Mind prompts.

## cluster-strong-lensing
- title: Cluster strong lensing — Source & Cluster arc
- ledger: draft/feature/autolens/source_cluster_arc.md
- notes: 12 phased prompts under draft/; issue phases ONE at a time as predecessors near shipping — no bulk issue queues.

## jax-compile-stall
- title: Intermittent XLA compile stall in the JAX vmap likelihood path
- ledger: draft/bug/ci/jax_vmap_jit_compile_stall.md
- notes: three phases under draft/bug/ci/ — 1 evidence (PyAutoFit watchdog), 2 SLOW-vs-stall audit, 3 root cause + un-quarantine. Phase 3 is blocked on phase 1 shipping and a CI stall actually dumping a traceback; issue phases ONE at a time. Supersedes draft/bug/autolens_workspace_test/multi_dataset_jax_likelihood_xla_stall.md.

## graphical-ep
- title: Expectation propagation (EP) campaign
- ledger: draft/research/graphical_ep/ep_campaign.md
- notes: umbrella phase map — each phase's real content lives in its own prompt under draft/research/graphical_ep/; the campaign file itself is never issued.
